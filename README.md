# Website Conversion Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the conversion rates of two different versions of an online retailer's website to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two. The analysis was conducted using hypothesis testing, binomial distribution simulations, and visualization techniques in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Version A:** Viewed by 3,250 customers, with 1,320 conversions.
- **Version B:** Viewed by 2,870 customers, with 1,250 conversions.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Methodology

1. **Calculate Conversion Rates:**
   - Determine the conversion rates for both website versions.

2. **Combined Proportion of Conversions:**
   - Calculate the combined conversion rate for all customers.

3. **Standard Error Calculation:**
   - Compute the standard error of the combined conversion rate.

4. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Perform a z-test to determine if there is a significant difference in conversion rates between the two versions.

5. **Binomial Distribution Simulation:**
   - Draw samples from a binomial distribution for both versions to simulate conversion counts.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Plot histograms of the simulated conversion counts for both versions.

## Results

The analysis indicated that there is no statistically significant difference in conversion rates between Version A and Version B.
